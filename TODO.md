WALK FORWARD TEST OPTIMIZATION
    Get all relevant data
    Break data into multiple pieces
    Run an optimisation to find the best parameters on the first piece of data (first in-sample)
    Apply those parameters on the second piece of data (first out-of-sample)
    Run an optimisation to find the best parameters on the next in-sample data
    Apply those parameters on the next out-of-sample data
    Repeat until youâ€™ve covered all the pieces of data
    Collate the performances of all the out-of-sample data
